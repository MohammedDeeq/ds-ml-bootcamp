Machine Learning Research Assignment



1\. Definition of Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a field of Artificial Intelligence where systems identify patterns in data to make decisions without being explicitly programmed for every task.



Real-Life Example: A Spam Filter learns to identify junk mail by analyzing thousands of examples of "spam" and "not spam" rather than following a fixed list of banned words.



2\. Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning?


|Feature|Supervised Learning|Unsupervised Learning|
|-|-|-|
|Data Type|Uses labeled data (input + correct answer).|Uses unlabeled data (raw input only).|
|Goal|To predict numbers or categories.|To find hidden structures or groups.|
|example|Predicting house prices based on size.|Grouping customers by similar buying habits.|



3. Overfitting: Causes and Prevention?

Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data "too well," including the noise and random fluctuations, making it fail on new data.



Causes: Using an overly complex model or having too many features relative to the amount of data.



Prevention: Use more training data, simplify the algorithm, or use regularization techniques.



4\. Training and Test Data Split?

The Process: The dataset is divided into a Training Set (usually 80%) to build the model and a Test Set (usually 20%) to check its performance.



Necessity: This split is required to ensure the model can generalize to unseen data rather than just memorizing the training set.



5\. Case Study: Machine Learning in Transportation?

Application: Self-Driving Cars.



Findings: ML algorithms process sensor data to detect pedestrians, traffic lights, and obstacles in real-time.



Result: By "learning" from millions of driving hours, the system improves its ability to navigate complex road environments safely.
